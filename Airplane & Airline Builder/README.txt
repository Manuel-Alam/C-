How to compile:

1. To compile all the files at once type "make" into the terminal.

2. The "make" command will compile all the files together and create object files and an executable "a4".

3. To run the program type "./a4" into the console.

4. Once the program is ran, a menu will pop up with 5 options.

5. Selecting options from 1 to 4 will cause the console to output the tester methods.

6. After selecting any option from 1 to 4 the selection menu will pop up again.

7. If option 0 is selected then the program will terminate.
